Design Process is shown below.  At each step tests were created in the Driver code.

- CityState Class
- CityStateList: Read in datafile into ArrayList of CityState objects

- CityDistance Class
- CityDistancesAdjacencyList: Read in datafile into Adjacency list representation, created by an ArrayList of ArrayLists.

- DijkstraGraph: Given the city distances and a starting city number, find a shortest path from the starting city to every other city.

- AllPairsShortest: Create an adjacency matrix and run Dijkstra's from the perspective of each starting city

- Participants Class
- ParticipantList: Read in participants datafile

- Driver: Use AllPairsShortest to find city with minimum average distance.
          Discovered that "average" is perhaps not the best metric.

          Driver is the starting point.
